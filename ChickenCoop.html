        <p style= "color: blue;" >One day, I was wondering what my new nickname should be on Pocketpixels. (<em>The IP on Minecraft for the server is play.pocketpixels.net</em>)<br /> <br />
Then, somebody said I should name myself ChickenAgro, and so I did. I was then officially a chicken. <strong>Don't question it</strong>
